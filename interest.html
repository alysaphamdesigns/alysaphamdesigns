    <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Interests</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I really enjoy watching animation films and hanging out with my cat.One of the most recent animation films I watched was Flow.I have recently
    taken up photography with an old point and shoot that I got gifted.I love thrifting and vintage fashion and clothes. I feel as if I am heavily inspired by
    the 90s. I love the music,fashion and aesthetic. But honestly I enjoy any vintage aesthetic (60s,70s,80s, etc.).</p>
